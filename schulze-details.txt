The "Schulze" method is a Condorcet method, with the added bonus that it can resolve circular ambiguities.
All Condorcet methods will produce the same results as long as there is no circular ambiguity.
For example, say your candidates were rock, paper, and scissors.
If paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, and scissors beats paper, there is a circular ambiguity.
Condorcet methods differ in which "Condorcet completion method" they use to resolve such cycles.

The "Schulze" method for resolving cycles
Lets say 5 voters prefer A to B, and 4 voters prefer B to C
One possible "path" from A to C is A-(5)-B-(4)-C.
A paths "strength" is the strength of its weakest link.  The strength of the path A-B-C in this example is 4
The Schulze method computes the strongest path between each pair of candidates, and uses that to rank the candidates.
This eliminates cycles, which allows the candidates to be ranked.

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm
This is a graph analysis algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph
It can be used to compute the strongest paths according to the Schulze method
